        Those were the parting words of my travel companion last month as she
        checked things off her packing list, one precious item at a time before
        we set out on a two-week road trip along the coast. “CBD oil?,” I asked.
        “Don’t knock it till you’ve tried it,” she replied.

        In fact, the world is awakening to the benefits of CBD, the
        non-psychoactive cousin to marijuana, and as more and more people try it
        out (in products as diverse as tinctures,

        <router-link to="/products/cbd-hemp-flower"
          >pre-rolled joints</router-link
        >), the number of naysayers is declining rapidly. Despite decades of
        stereotypes, depicting marijuana users as red-eyed stoners with a
        burrito in hand, CBD is redefining the cannabis landscape, putting the
        plant firmly on the map of the mainstream.

      <h2>What Is CBD?</h2>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>
            CBD (also known as cannabidiol) is a non-psychoactive compound found
            in the cannabis plant.
          </em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>There are a few important things to note here:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          First, CBD is just one of the compounds found in cannabis
          <a
            href="https://www.uclahealth.org/cannabis/cannabis-and-its-compounds"
            >(there are over 500 in total)</a
          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          Second, CBD is
          <strong>non</strong>-psychoactive, which means it does
          <em>not</em> get you high.
        </li>
      </ul>

        A report from the
        <a
          href="http://www.who.int/medicines/access/controlled-substances/5.2_CBD.pdf"
          >World Health Organization</a
        >
        states:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>
            “In humans, CBD exhibits no effects indicative of any abuse or
            dependence potential…. To date, there is no evidence of public
            health related problems associated with the use of pure CBD.”

      <h2>Differences Between CBD and Marijuana</h2>

      <p>
        So what is the difference between marijuana (most commonly thought of as
        a favorite pastime for adolescents cutting class) and CBD (a newfound
        favorite for

          >senior citizens</a
        >
        alike)?
      </p>

      <p>Let’s start by taking one step back:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The plant
            <em>Cannabis sativa</em> has two primary species, hemp and
            marijuana.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p />
          <p>
            <em>Marijuana</em> is rich in THC, the psychoactive compound that
            gets you high.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Hemp</em>, on the other hand, contains a significantly lower
            amount of THC (in fact, in order to be legally cultivated, hemp must
            contain less than 0.3% THC), and is rich in CBD, which, as we’ve
            already covered, will not have you trolling Uber Eats at 3 a.m.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Scientifically Speaking...</h2>

      <p>
        Scientists have identified two receptors in the human body that respond
        to cannabis - CB1 and CB2. These receptors are part of the larger
        endocannabinoid system, which helps your body regulate the hormones that
        influence appetite, pain sensation, mood, memory, anxiety, and more.
      </p>

      <p>
        Scientifically speaking, both CBD and THC have the exact same molecular
        structure:
        <a
          href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cbd-vs-thc#chemical-structure"
          >21 carbon atoms, 30 hydrogen atoms, and 2 oxygen atoms</a
        >. A tiny difference in how the atoms are arranged leads to different
        effects on your body. Jeffrey Raber, CEO of California-based cannabis
        chemistry lab, The Werc Shop, describes it well:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>“It's a wildly different key going into the lock."</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Where THC binds with the Cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptors in the brain
        (producing a high), CBD binds very weakly, if at all, to CB1 receptors,
        but has a stronger affinity for CB2 receptors. A bunch of very
        particular reactions occur in the middle and the result is that THC
        produces psychoactive effects by affecting the brain and spinal cord,
        while CBD acts on the receptors that help reduce inflammation (aiding in
        a number of ailments) without being psychoactive.
      </p>

      <h2>Is CBD Legal?</h2>

      <p>
        Let’s switch now from Science 101 to study the law, more specifically,
        if CBD is legal. From the explosion of mainstream CBD-infused products,
        you probably assume it is. But you know what they say about assuming…
      </p>

      <p>
        The exact legality of CBD (at least in the U.S.) is a bit confusing, and
        depends in part on whether the CBD comes from hemp or marijuana. The
        Drug Enforcement Administration maintains that
        <a
          href="https://www.wthr.com/article/dea-feds-wont-arrest-cbd-oil-users-neither-should-indiana"
          >CBD is federally illegal</a
        >
        (but won’t go after anyone for possessing or using it). But many argue
        that the 2018 Farm Bill (which made hemp an agricultural commodity) took
        away the DEA’s authority over hemp and, as a result, CBD from hemp is
        now legal nationwide. Even under that assumption however, there is still
        an important consideration -
        <a href="https://cbdee.com/cbd-101/"
          >only CBD containing less 0.3% of THC is legal in all 50 states</a
        >
        so quality is key.
      </p>

      <p>
        On an international level, CBD is
        <a
          href="https://www.royalqueenseeds.com/blog-where-in-the-world-is-cbd-legal-n950"
          >legal in</a
        >
        Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Romania, Italy, and Spain. Ditto
        for Canada. Cheers to our neighbours to the north.
      </p>

      <h2>Potential Health Benefits and Uses of CBD</h2>

      <p>
        It’s important to note before we get into the next section that
        <strong>
          Pure CBD Exchange makes no claims about the medical or health benefits
          of CBD </strong
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        In June 2018, the Food and Drug Administration
        <a
          href="https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm611046.htm"
          >approved</a
        >
        the use of Epidiolex as a medication to treat rare forms of epilepsy –
        it was the first prescription medication to contain CBD. With the
        exception of Epidiolex,
        <strong>
          the FDA has not approved CBD to treat any other medical conditions.
          The below resources and articles are listed only provide an index of
          studies and areas where CBD shows promise as a medical treatment. One
          or two studies does not guarantee that CBD will work as a treatment
          for a given condition or that it should be used for one. Even if
          approved as a treatment for a certain condition by the FDA, there’s no
          guarantee that CBD will prove effective for you and your body.
        </strong>
        Every human body is different and each responds to different substances
        in different ways. Consult your physician before taking any CBD
        supplement.
      </p>

      <p>
        With that out of the way, CBD has been touted for many possible health
        benefits, including:
        <br />
      </p>

      <h3>Anxiety and Stress</h3>

      <p>
        The ingestion of cannabis and CBD for anxiety appears in a Vedic text
        dated around 2000 BCE, so suffice to say this is truly an ancient remedy
        for today’s modern times. CBD has been shown to reduce anxiety in a
        number of animal and human studies and this is one of the most common
        reasons people today seek out this compound in everything from
        <a

        to

        <router-link to="/products/cbd-hemp-flower"
          >pure hemp flower</router-link
        >.
      </p>

      <h3>Acne</h3>

      <p>
        The skin has the highest amount and concentration of CB2 receptors in
        the body, so it’s not surprising that many CBD-infused products are
        being
        <a href="https://www.consciouslifestylemag.com/cbd-health-benefits/"
          >touted as a treatment for acne</a
        >.
      </p>

      <h3>Depression</h3>

      <p>
        Cannabinoids can have a positive effect on serotonin levels, a chemical
        messenger that is believed to act as a mood stabilizer in the body. CBD
        might
        <a
          href="https://www.consciouslifestylemag.com/foods-for-depression-diet-and-nutrition/"
          >be especially effective for depression</a
        >
        related to chronic stress.
      </p>

      <h3>Arthritis and Pain Management</h3>

      <p>
        Of all the reasons that people use CBD today, pain is the most common…
        <a href="https://www.consciouslifestylemag.com/cbd-health-benefits/"
          >and one of the most historic</a
        >.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>
            160 years ago noted neurologist, epilepsy research pioneer and
            physician, Sir John Russell Reynolds, wrote to Queen Victoria, “For
            the relief of certain kinds of pain, I believe, there is no more
            useful medicine than Cannabis within our reach.”
          </em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Migraines</h3>

      <p>
        Some laboratory studies have suggested that CBD oil may help all forms
        of chronic and acute pain,
        <a
          href="https://www.healthline.com/health/migraine/cbd-oil-for-migraines#research"
          >including migraines</a
        >.
      </p>

      <h3>Diabetes and Obesity</h3>

      <p>
        Several
        <a href="https://www.consciouslifestylemag.com/cbd-health-benefits/"
          >studies have shown</a
        >
        that regular cannabis users have a lower body mass index and a reduced
        risk of diabetes and obesity. In 2015, an Israeli-American
        biopharmaceutical collective began stage 2 trials studying the use of
        CBD to treat diabetes.
      </p>

      <h3>Alzheimer’s</h3>

      <p>
        Cannabinoids are
        <a href="https://www.consciouslifestylemag.com/cbd-health-benefits/"
          >neuroprotective</a
        >, which means they help maintain and regulate brain health and CBD has
        also been shown to have an anti-inflammatory effect on the brain, both
        of which hold promising outlooks for the treatment of nerve-related
        diseases like neuropathy and Alzheimer’s.
      </p>

      <h3>Sleep Disorders</h3>

      <p>
        <a
          href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/cannabidiol-cbd-what-we-know-and-what-we-dont-2018082414476"
          >Studies suggest</a
        >
        that CBD may help with both falling asleep and staying asleep,
        alleviating some of the suffering brought on by insomnia.
      </p>

      <p>
        In general, more studies are needed to definitively substantiate the
        claims of positive health benefits from CBD, but for many people, the
        proof is seeing it with their very own eyes. “I’m a true convert because
        it works for me,” said Sara Rotman, a former New York–based creative
        director turned cannabis farmer. Sara was interviewed in
        <a

        turning to CBD to cure the debilitating pain she suffered as a side
        effect of Crohn’s disease.

      <h2>Different Ways to Use CBD Products</h2>

      <p>How many ways are there to use CBD? How much time do you have?</p>

      <p>
        Whatever your tastes, chances are you can find a CBD-infused product to

        will be a $1 billion pie by 2020.
      </p>

      <p>
        So what’s the best way to CBD? The answer is, it depends. But here are
        some of the most popular methods available.
      </p>

      <h3>Tinctures</h3>

      <p>
        A "tincture" is a fancy name for CBD oil in a
        <a
          href="https://purecbdexchange.com/product-category/cbd-tinctures-and-topicals/"
          >discreet little eye dropper</a
        >
        that you take by placing a few drops under your tongue. This is

          >the second-fastest way to absorb CBD</a
        >
        (after smoking), and one of the most popular methods to enjoy the
        <a href="https://cbdorigin.com/cbd-benefits-many-conditions"
          >many benefits of CBD</a
        >. Available in different doses
        <a
          href="https://purecbdexchange.com/product/cbd-tinctures-and-topicals/cbd-tinctures-500mg/"
          >(Pure CBD Exchange</a
        >, for example, offers tinctures in concentrations of 2500mg, 1500mg,
        1000mg, and 500mg), tinctures are generally mixed with some type of oil
        to improve flavor and aid in absorption.
      </p>

      <h3>Smoking</h3>

      <p>
        For purists,
        <router-link to="/products/cbd-hemp-flower"
          >all-natural CBD hemp flower</router-link
        >&nbsp;may be the ideal form of consumption, either in all its
        plant-like glory or ready-to-smoke in pre-rolled joints. Smoking offers
        <a
          href="https://benicepaper.com/archives/2018/12/23/cbd-you-can-smoke-hemp-premium-prerolls"
          >the highest bioavailability of CBD</a
        >, which basically means you get more CBD into your system, faster than
        other forms of consumption.
        <a href="https://cbdoilreview.org/cbd-cannabidiol/cbd-entourage-effect/"
          >Mounting evidence suggests</a
        >
        that CBD may be more effective in its whole and natural state (an
        outcome known as the
        <strong>entourage effect</strong>).
      </p>

      <h3>Vaping</h3>

      <p>
        Vaping involves a vape pen that heats up a small portion of concentrated
        CBD oil until it boils, allowing you to inhale the vapor. Controlling
        dosing can be difficult, as how much CBD you absorb depends on how hard
        and how long you inhale, but vaping is also
        <a href="https://www.pain-health.com/blog/5-ways-consume-cbd"
          >one of the quickest ways to get CBD into the bloodstream</a
        >
        (though for the shortest period of time). This makes vaping an
        accessible vehicle for a near-instant effect.
      </p>

      <h3>Edibles</h3>

      <p>
        Consuming edibles is an excellent alternative to smoking or vaping
        because they’re discreet, easy to use, and come in just about any form

      <h3>Lotions, Salves, and Creams</h3>

      <p>
        The options for CBD-laced beauty balms are seemingly endless and run the
        gamut from
        <a href="https://www.saintjanebeauty.com/products/luxury-beauty-serum"
          >luxury serums</a
        >
        fit for red-carpet royalty, to no-nonsense,
        <a href="https://skindope.com/products/best-cbd-oil-skincare"
          >uber-functional</a
        >
        balms and topical creams. Topical applications may not be as fast acting
        or as potent as some of the other options on this list, but they’re easy
        to apply and offer some promising benefits including relief from dry
        skin, acne, and anxiety-induced wrinkles to boot.
      </p>

      <h2>Dosing</h2>

      <p>
        CBD dosing is a confusing topic. Unlike other supplements, the
        <a
          href="https://medium.com/cbd-origin/whats-the-best-cbd-dosage-81ec4f95503b"
          >FDA has not created a Recommended Daily Intake (RDI)</a
        >
        for CBD, and CBD does not have an official serving size. How much you
        should take depends on a variety of factors, including the concentration
        of the CBD in the product, the method of consumption, individual
        characteristics like your genetic makeup, gender, weight, potency of the
        strain, and what you’re hoping to achieve by using it. One person might
        simply be using CBD to promote general health, while another might be
        using it to address acne or insomnia. The amount of CBD that person
        takes will differ accordingly.
      </p>

      <p>
        To give us a starting point,
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBn8SKZoWyQ&amp;t=5s"
          >previous studies</a
        >
        have said that around 300 milligrams daily are required to achieve
        stress-relieving results, but
        <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6326553/"
          >new research</a
        >
        shows that as little as 25 milligrams a day can elicit positive effects.
        That’s important news, especially since it makes any CBD regimen more
        affordable and accessible for people seeking relief and results.
      </p>

      <p>
        Determining your ideal serving might take a little patience and
        experimentation, but whether you’re consuming CBD for the first time, or
        you’re a regular user, it’s always a good idea to start small and
        progress slowly so you can determine what works best for you. A 2018
        article from
        <a
          href="https://medium.com/cbd-origin/whats-the-best-cbd-dosage-81ec4f95503b"
        >
          <em>Medium</em>
        </a>
        recommended using three simple steps to determine your ideal dose:
      </p>

      <ol type="1">
        <li>Estimate your dosage based on your body weight</li>
        <p>
          A good rule of thumb is 1-6 milligrams of CBD for every 10 pounds of
          body weight. For example, 20-33 milligrams would be a good starting
          dosage for a 200 lb patient, while 15-25 milligrams would be best for
          someone who weighs 150 lb.
        </p>
        <li>Start small and increase gradually</li>
        <p>
          Determine your initial dosage based on your weight, then gauge how
          your body reacts to that amount of CBD. Increase gradually (continuing
          to monitor your body’s reactions) until you achieve the desired
          results.
        </p>
        <li>Consult your physician</li>
        <p>
          When in doubt, consult your physician, especially if you have an
          existing medical condition.
        </p>
      </ol>

      <h2>Quality Counts</h2>

      <p>
        Since the market for CBD is unregulated, it can be difficult to know
        what you’re getting. A 2015
        <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2338239"
          >study by the F.D.A.</a
        >
        revealed that many CBD-labeled products actually contained very little
        CBD.
        <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2661569"
          >A 2017 article in JAMA</a
        >
        reported that, in a study of 84 products sold online, 26% contained less
        CBD than advertised and 43% contained more. A
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBn8SKZoWyQ">2017 study</a> by
        the American Medical Association of 84 CBD products purchased online,
        found that almost 70% were mislabeled with respect to the amount of CBD.
      </p>

      <p>
        With such wildly varying results, it’s no wonder some people are wary of
        trying CBD. But it’s important to know what you’re getting because, when
        it comes to what you put into your body, quality counts and low-quality
        CBD products won’t provide you with the same benefits as high-quality
        products.
      </p>

      <p>
        Do your research. Don’t be afraid to reach out to companies and ask
        questions. Look for brands that are transparent and committed to
        quality, like
        <a href="https://aspenvalleycbd.com/">Aspen Valley Hemp Company</a> and
        <a href="https://purecbdexchange.com/">Pure CBD Exchange</a> who use
        only the cleanest and most potent varieties available, grown naturally,
        and hand selected from growers across the country, ensuring an
        exceptionally pure product, straight from nature, and ready to consume,
        however you choose.
      </p>

      <p>In general, be sure to look for:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Third party testing (companies that stand behind their products don’t
          have anything to hide).
        </li>
        <li>
          Products with less than 0.3% THC (the standard to be considered an
          industrial hemp product, making them legal in all 50 states).
        </li>
        <li>
          Naturally-derived products sourced in the U.S. (hemp is a heavily
          regulated commodity in the U.S., so domestically-sourced products will
          be Farm Bill Compliant and of higher quality).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <p>
        We’ve covered quite an encyclopedia of CBD info in this guide, but
        before we wrap up, here are some of the questions we hear most often:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Will CBD make me high?</li>
        <p>
          No. Quality CBD products, derived from hemp, contain less than 0.3%
          THC, not enough to get you high.
        </p>
        <li>What are the side effects of CBD?</li>
        <p>
          You would have to consume quite a bit of CBD before it results in any
          truly
          <a href="https://joyorganics.com/ultimate-guide-to-cbd-oil/"
            >adverse health effects</a
          >
          but CBD is an organic compound, so its effects can vary from
          individual to individual. A
          <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/"
            >2017 literature review</a
          >
          noted that CBD oil can, in some cases, be linked to fatigue,
          lightheadedness, changes in appetite, and dry mouth. Check with your
          doctor if you’re unsure about interactions with certain medications or
          if CBD is right for you. And always start slow and increase your
          dosage gradually to achieve the desired effect.
        </p>
        <li>How do I take CBD?</li>
        <p>
          You can take CBD in a number of ways including smoking, vaping,
          edibles, oils, and creams or lotions.
        </p>
        <li>Is CBD legal to use in all 50 states?</li>
        <p>
          Yes. Hemp is
          <a href="https://cbdee.com/cbd-101/">legal in the United States</a>
          provided that the plant contains less than 0.3% THC by dry weight.
        </p>
        <li>Are there studies on CBD?</li>
        <p>
          Thousands of scientific studies have been carried out on CBD.
          <a href="https://www.projectcbd.org/">Project CBD</a> is a
          California-based nonprofit organization dedicated to publicizing
          research into the medical uses of CBD for physicians, patients,
          industry professionals, and the general public.
        </p>
      </ol>

      <h2>Find a Company You Trust and Stick with Them</h2>

      <p>
        CBD is a complicated product and the current market can be confusing for
        newcomers and experienced users alike, but by following some of the
        recommendations laid out in this guide, you’ll be well positioned to dip
        a toe into the (extremely calm) waters of CBD or to cannonball into the
        deep end of cannabidiol.
      </p>

      <p>
        Perhaps the best takeaway is this: find a good company that you trust
        and stick with them. That’s a proven path to a more present, grounded,
        CBD-centred state of mind.

Even under that assumption however, there is still an important consideration - only CBD containing less 0.3% of THC is legal in all 50 states so quality is key.
