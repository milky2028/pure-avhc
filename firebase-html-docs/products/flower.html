<h3>What is CBD Flower?</h3>

<p>CBD Flower is the all-natural plant material used to make CBD Oil products. However, unlike the hemp biomass that may
  be used to make CBD extracts, CBD Flower contains only the highest quality premium buds. CBD extracts may contain
  almost any part of the hemp plant, but our flower jars contain only the female flowers, scientifically known as
  <em>Cola</em>.</p>

<p>This makes flower, interchangeably also called bud, ideal for smoking and creating your own extracts, such as oil or
  butter. Our flower is hand-selected from growers across the country and is rich in terpenes and the <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entourage_effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a> found in hemp
  plants.</p>

<p>Our CBD buds test between 14 - 20% CBD, with less than 0.3% delta-9 THC.</p>

<h3>How does CBD Flower differ from <a href="/products/cbd-hemp-cigarettes">CBD Cigarettes</a> and <a
    href="/products/cbd-hemp-joints">CBD Joints</a>?</h3>

<p>CBD Flower is the same plant material that goes into our fantastic CBD Joints, but CBD Cigarettes use a different,
  leafier shake material that allows the cigarettes burn more smoothly for an experience more similar traditional
  tobacco
  consumption. None of our products contain tobacco.</p>

<p>Jars of flower offer more flexibility than pre-rolled joints and may present more options for CBD consumers who do
  not
  wish to smoke CBD, but may be more interested in the unprocessed benefits that pure flower presents.</p>
