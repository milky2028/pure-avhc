<p>Allegedly named after the iconic tomato cultivar Mortgage Lifter, Lifter is a high-CBD hemp strain with an
  exceptional
  taste and appearance. Its high<a href="https://www.coloradopotguide.com/marijuana-glossary/trichome/" target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;trichome</a> production gives each bud a frosty look, while also imbuing dark green
  shades
  and brownish undertones.</p>
<p>Lifter carries a pungent aroma of fruity scents that come directly from the plantâ€™s genetic
  profile. Its taste is equally sweet, resembling tropical fruit with a hint of blueberries. Lifter is a hybrid between
  Suver Haze and Early Resin Bud.</p>
