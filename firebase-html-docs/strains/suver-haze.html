<p>A cross between Special Sauce and Nevilleâ€™s Haze, Suze Haze is a testament to the rich farming and social history of
  a
  suver road in Oregon. Suver Haze has a memorable, invigorating terpene profile with sweet and tart undertones
  reminiscent of an old-school haze. These dense furry buds produce an uplifting, high-energy, creative buzz appropriate
  for any activity!</p>
