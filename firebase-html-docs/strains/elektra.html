<p>Formed from a combination of high-CBD ERB and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
    href="https://www.leafly.com/strains/acdc">ACDC</a> strains, a standard Elektra bud has almost 16 percent CBD and
  less
  than 0.3 percent THC content. Developed mainly in Oregon, Elektra hemp flowers feel sticky to the touch and have an
  intense green color peppered with orange stripes. This sativa-dominant hybrid strain is famed for its fabulous forest
  scent, particularly reminiscent of pine trees.</p>
<p>When smoking Elektra, you might often taste an intriguing mix of
  tropical
  flavors, citrus fruits, and earthy tones.Â  Interestingly, some of the same terpenes found in Elektra are also in
  mangoes, lemons, and pine leaves.</p>
