<h2>Description</h2>
<p>For traditional cannabis smokers, Aspen Valley Hemp Company’s Pre-Rolled CBD Joints are the absolute best smokable experience you can find. Rolled to perfection, CBD Joints are a classic cannabis experience you can enjoy on your own or share with a friend.</p>

<p>Our CBD flower is grown naturally. Rich in terpenes and cannabinoids, CBD pre-rolls look like traditional cannabis and smell like traditional cannabis but maintain less than 0.3% delta-9 THC. Low levels of THC allow smokers to feel a mellow, calming buzz without the paranoia or fatigue sometimes associated with high-THC products.</p>

<h3>What’s the difference between CBD Hemp Cigarettes and Pre-Rolled Joints?</h3>

<p><a href="/products/cbd-hemp-cigarettes">CBD Hemp Cigarettes</a> are made of a leafier shake material in order to burn and pack correctly. Our CBD Cigarettes do not contain nicotine or tobacco, but they may be more familiar to traditional tobacco smokers. Pre-rolled joints are larger and made of premium ground bud, just like what’s sold in our jars of <a href="/products/cbd-hemp-flower">CBD flower</a>.</p>

<p>Our CBD buds test between 15-21% CBD, with less than 0.3% delta-9 THC. Each pack contains 12 joints with just under 1 gram of bud in each pre-roll.</p>

<h3>What is CBD Flower?</h3>
<p>Aspen Valley’s CBD flower is an all-natural alternative to CBD oil products. Our CBD Flower is hand-selected from growers from across the country. CBD pre-rolls offer the most natural CBD experience by taking you back to the plant itself. </p>

<p>Flower is actual plant material that CBD oil products are extracted from. Due to the way CBD is extracted from plant mass, this means that all sorts of different parts of the hemp plant may go the biomass that eventually makes CBD lotions, oils, and tinctures. With CBD Flower, only the highest quality buds are selected from premium plants. Buds, also colloquially known as flowers, contain the majority of the plant’s cannabinoid contents, making them ideal for CBD consumption. The end result is an organically-grown, hand-selected, non-psychoactive smokable CBD experience unlike anything else.</p>
